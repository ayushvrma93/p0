# Harbor Take Home Project

Welcome to the Harbor take home project. We hope this is a good opportunity for you to showcase your skills.

## The Challenge

Build us a REST API for calendly. Remember to support

- Setting own availability
- Showing own availability
- Finding overlap in schedule between 2 users

It is up to you what else to support.

## Expectations

We care about

- Have you thought through what a good MVP looks like? Does your API support that?
- What trade-offs are you making in your design?
- Working code - we should be able to pull and hit the code locally. Bonus points if deployed somewhere.
- Any good engineer will make hacks when necessary - what are your hacks and why?

We don't care about

- Authentication
- UI
- Perfection - good and working quickly is better

It is up to you how much time you want to spend on this project. There are likely diminishing returns as the time spent goes up.

## Submission

Please fork this repository and reach out to Prakash when finished.

## Next Steps

After submission, we will conduct a 30 to 60 minute code review in person. We will ask you about your thinking and design choices.

## Supported Functional Requirements
- Setting up own availability.
- Showing own availability.

[//]: # (- A user can make some of their own time slots as un-blockable.)
- Finding overlap in schedule between 2 users.
- See availability of users, using email id for given start and end time range.
- Book a meeting.
- If a person's slot is already booked for a given time slot, we can still book it, the respondee has to decide which booking they have to entertain.

[//]: # (## Assumptions:)

[//]: # (- )

## Constraints
- A meeting must have exactly 2 people.
- We will not support recurring meetings(as a part of MVP).

[//]: # (- We will support viewing of meetings up-to next 3 months.)
- We will support only one timezone. 

## Improvements
- Instead of setting up own availability, we can set up blocked time and all other slots are open by default.
